He nodded. "It's a reflection of the times. Expectations for the future are dismal, not hopeful like they used to be."
"You're far too young to be aware like that," I told him. An idea occurred to me. "If you're into horror, do you know anything about strange creatures?"
"Sure. I read everything I can. I love it."
Warily, I scanned the entrances to the living room. Everyone was busy outside. For the first time, I opened up to someone in my life about what I was experiencing. In hushed tones, I told him about my fragmented consciousness.
For a teenager, he took it well. "You're serious?"
"Yes."
He donned the determined look of a grown man accepting a quest. "I'll look into it, see what I can find out. You should start writing down everything you experience. Build some data. Maybe we can map your psychic wound."
Wow. "Sounds like a plan." I was surprised. That made sense, and I hadn't expected him to have a serious response. "But how will I get all the notes in one place?"
"Let's come up with somewhere for you to leave them," he said, frowning with thought. "Then I'll get them, and we can trace the path you're taking through your own life, see if there's a pattern."
For the first time since the situation had gotten worse, I felt hope again. "How about under the stairs? Nobody ever goes under there."
"Sure." He turned and left the living room.
I peered after him. I heard him banging around near the stairs.
Finally, he returned with a box, laid it on the carpet, and opened it to reveal a bursting stack of papers. He exclaimed, "Holy crap!"â€”but of course, being a teenager, he didn't really say crap.
Taken aback, I blinked rapidly, forgiving his cussing because of the shock. "Did I write those?"
